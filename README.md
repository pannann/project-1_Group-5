Using data from the data.cms.gov we aim to determine the following questions on a state basis:

Examine the correlation between state medicaid spending and readmission rates

Which states have the highest readmission rates / which states have the lowest readmission rates?

Do hospitals with higher rates of associated infections have higher readmission rates?

Is there a connection between outpatient imaging efficiency score and readmission rates.

Does timely and efficient care correlate to readmission

Will be using state level data and attempting to access it by API and with provided CSVs.
